    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="docstring" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Approvers are clients that notify the user that new channels have
        been created by a contact, and allow the user to accept or reject
        those channels. The new channels are represented by a <a href="Channel_Dispatch_Operation.html" namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy" title="Interface org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation">ChannelDispatchOperation</a>
        object, which is passed to the
        <a href="Client_Approver.html#Method:AddDispatchOperation" title="Method org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Approver.AddDispatchOperation">AddDispatchOperation</a> method.</p>

      <div class="rationale"><h5>Rationale:</h5><div>
        <p>For instance, Empathy's tray icon, or the answer/reject window
          seen when a Maemo device receives a VoIP call, should be
          Approvers.</p>
      </div></div>

      <p>Approvers can also select which channel handler will be used for the
        channel, for instance by offering the user a list of possible
        handlers rather than just an accept/reject choice.
        However, the Channel Dispatcher must be able to prioritize
        possible handlers on its own using some reasonable heuristic,
        probably based on user configuration.</p>

      <p>It is possible (and useful) to have an approver and
        a channel handler in the same process; this is particularly useful
        if a channel handler wants to claim responsibility for particular
        channels itself.</p>

      <p>All approvers are notified simultaneously. For instance, in a
        desktop system, there might be one approver that displays a
        notification-area icon, one that is part of a contact list
        window and highlights contacts there, and one that is part
        of a full-screen media player.</p>

      <p>Any approver can approve the handling of a channel dispatch operation
        with a particular channel handler by calling the <a href="Channel_Dispatch_Operation.html#Method:HandleWith" namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation" title="Method org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation.HandleWith">HandleWith</a>
        method. Approvers can also attempt to <a href="Channel_Dispatch_Operation.html#Method:Claim" namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation" title="Method org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation.Claim">Claim</a>
        channels; if this succeeds, the approver may handle the channels
        itself (if it is also a Handler), or close the channels in order to
        reject them.</p>

      <p>At the D-Bus level, there is no &quot;reject&quot; operation: approvers wishing
        to reject channels SHOULD call the Claim method, then (if it succeeds)
        close the channels in any way they see fit.</p>

      <p>The first approver to reply gets its decision acted on; any other
        approvers that reply at approximately the same time will get a D-Bus
        error, indicating that the channel has already been dealt with.</p>

      <p>Approvers should usually prompt the user and ask for
        confirmation, rather than dispatching the channel to a handler
        straight away.</p>

      <p>Non-interactive approvers can also be implemented as
        <a href="Client_Observer.html" namespace="ofdT.Client" title="Interface org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Observer">Observer</a>s as
        described in the interface description.</p>

          <div class="rationale"><h5>Rationale:</h5><div>
            <p>This can't be signalled to the approver through the Properties
              parameter of this method, because Channels is not an immutable
              property.</p>
          </div></div>

          <p>This argument always contains all of the channels in the channel
            dispatch operation, even if not all of them actually match
            the <a href="Client_Approver.html#Property:ApproverChannelFilter" title="Property org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Approver.ApproverChannelFilter">ApproverChannelFilter</a>.</p>

          <div class="rationale"><h5>Rationale:</h5><div>
            <p>This seems the least bad way to handle such a situation;
              see the discussion on
              <a href="http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21090">bug
                #21090</a>.</p>
          </div></div>

          <p>The actual channels to be dispatched may reduce as channels are
            closed: this is signalled by <a href="Channel_Dispatch_Operation.html#Signal:ChannelLost" namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy" title="Signal org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation.ChannelLost">ChannelDispatchOperation.ChannelLost</a>.
          </p>

          <p>Approvers SHOULD connect to ChannelLost and <a href="Channel_Dispatch_Operation.html#Signal:Finished" namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy" title="Signal org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation.Finished">ChannelDispatchOperation.Finished</a>.
            (if desired) before returning from AddDispatchOperation, since
            those signals are guaranteed not to be emitted until after all
            AddDispatchOperation calls have returned (with success or failure)

          operations already exist.</p>

        <p>The channel dispatcher SHOULD call this method on all approvers
          at the same time. If an approver returns an error from this method,
          the approver is assumed to be faulty.</p>

        <p>If no approvers return from this method
          successfully (including situations where there are no matching
          approvers at all), the channel dispatcher SHOULD consider this
          to be an error, and recover by dispatching the channel to the
