    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="docstring" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>This connection interface is for protocols that are capable of
        signaling to remote contacts that incoming communication channels
        should be instead sent to a separate contact.  This might apply to
        things such as call forwarding, for example.</p>

      <p>In some cases, a CM may register forwarding rules with an external
        service; in those cases, it will never see the incoming channel, and
        the forwarding will happen automatically.</p>

      <p>In other cases, the CM will handle the forwarding itself.  When an
        incoming channel is detected, the status of the local user will
        determine whether or not a forwarding rule is matched.  For some
        rules, this MAY happen immediately (ie, if the user is Busy); for
        others, there MAY be a timeout (in seconds) that must expire
        before the forwarding rule is matched (the timeout is specified
        by the first element in the <a href="Connection_Interface_Forwarding.html#Struct:Forwarding_Rule_Entry">Forwarding_Rule_Entry</a> list).</p>

      <p>Once a forwarding rule is matched and any necessary timeouts have
        expired, the CM can forward the incoming channel to the specified
        handle.  If for whatever reason the remote handle does not accept
        the channel AND the CM supports multiple forwarding entries AND
        any necessary timeouts have expired (specified by the next entry
        in the list), the CM can forward the incoming channel to the next
        handle in the entry list.  This continues until the list is
        exhausted, or the incoming channel is accepted.</p>

      <p>Note that the rule matches are only for the first entry in the
        in the forwarding rule list.  Once the incoming channel has been
        forwarded, the next entry in the list (assuming one exists and
        the contact that the channel has been forwarded to does not respond
        after any necessary timeouts) is used regardless of the status of
        the forwarded channel.  The initial match rule might have been
        Busy, whereas the contact that the channel has been forwarded to
        might be offline.  Even in this case, the Busy list is still
        traversed until the channel is handled (or there are no more
        forwarding entries in the list).</p>

      <p>For example, assuming the following dict for Forwarding_Rules:</p>
      <pre>
        ForwardingRules = {
          Busy: ( initial-timeout: 30, [
            (handle: 3, timeout: 15),
            (handle: 5, timeout: 20)
          ]),
          NoReply: ( initial-timeout: 15, [
            (handle: 5, timeout: 30),
            (handle: 3, timeout: 20)
          ])
        }</pre>

      <p>We can imagine a scenario where an incoming channel is detected,
        the media stream is available (ie, not Busy),
        and the local user is online.  While the CM is waiting for the local user to
        accept the channel, it looks at NoReply's first timeout value.  After 15s if
        the local user hasn't accepted, the CM forwards the channel to Handle #5.  The
        CM then waits 30s for Handle #5 to accept the channel.  If after 30s it does
        not, the CM forwards the incoming channel to Handle #3, which will have
        20s to accept the channel.</p>

      <p>When an unanswered <a href="Channel_Type_Streamed_Media.html" namespace="ofdT.Channel.Type" title="Interface org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.StreamedMedia">StreamedMedia</a> call is
        forwarded, both the contact and the self handle should be removed from
        the group with the self handle as the actor, and
        <a href="Channel_Interface_Group.html#Enum:Channel_Group_Change_Reason">Channel_Group_Change_Reason</a> <code>No_Answer</code> or
        <code>Busy</code>, as appropriate. For <a href="Channel_Type_Call.html" namespace="ofdT.Channel.Type" title="Interface org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call1">Call1</a> channels, the
        <a href="Channel_Type_Call.html#Enum:Call_State_Change_Reason">Call_State_Change_Reason</a> <code>Forwarded</code>
        should be used.</p>

          <p>The forwarding rule to override.  Note that this SHOULD not affect
            other rules; setting a rule that overrides others (such as
            Forwarding_Rule_Unconditional) will not modify other rules.  This
            means that when a client sets Forwarding_Rule_Busy and then
            temporarily sets Forwarding_Rule_Unconditional, the
            Forwarding_Rule_Busy rule will retain settings after
            Forwarding_Rule_Unconditional, has been unset.</p>

          <p>If the CM has no choice but to adjust multiple rules after a call
            to this function (ie, due to the network or protocol forcing such
            behavior), the CM MUST emit multiple <a href="Connection_Interface_Forwarding.html#Signal:ForwardingRuleChanged" title="Signal org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.Interface.Forwarding.DRAFT.ForwardingRuleChanged">ForwardingRuleChanged</a>
            signals for each changed rule.  The order of the signals is
            implementation-dependent, with the only requirement that the
            last signal is for the rule that was originally requested to have
            been changed (e.g. if Unconditional automatically modifies
            Busy and NoReply, three
            separate <a href="Connection_Interface_Forwarding.html#Signal:ForwardingRuleChanged" title="Signal org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.Interface.Forwarding.DRAFT.ForwardingRuleChanged">ForwardingRuleChanged</a> signals should be raised with the
            last signal being for Forwarding_Rule_Unconditional).</p>

          <p>Each forwarding condition will occur no more than once in
            the rule array.  Setting a rule will overwrite the old rule
            with the same <a href="Connection_Interface_Forwarding.html#Enum:Forwarding_Condition">Forwarding_Condition</a> in its entirety.</p>

        The various forwarding conditions that are supported by this interface.
        In general, the conditions should not overlap; it should be very clear
        which rule would be chosen given a CM's behavior with an incoming
        channel.  The exception to this is Unconditional,
        which will override all other rules.
      </div>
      <ul>
<li>Unconditional (0)</li>
<div class="docstring">
          Incoming channels should always be forwarded.  Note that setting this
          will override any other rules.  If not set, other rules will
          be checked when an incoming communication channel is detected.

<div class="docstring" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
          <p>The incoming channel should be forwarded if a busy signal is
            detected.  What defines &quot;Busy&quot; is CM-specific (perhaps a single
            resource is already in use, or a user's status is set to Busy
            <a href="Connection_Interface_Simple_Presence.html#Enum:Connection_Presence_Type">Connection_Presence_Type</a>).</p>

          <p>If initial timeout is specified for Busy condition and call
            waiting is not supported by the service, the timeout will be
            ignored.</p>

<div class="docstring">
          The incoming channel should be forwarded if the local user doesn't

<div class="docstring">
          The incoming channel should be forwarded if the user is offline.
          This could be a manual setting (the user has chosen to set their
          presence to offline or invisible) or something specified by the
          underlying network (the user is not within range of a cell tower).
